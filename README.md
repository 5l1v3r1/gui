# FreeNAS 10 GUI Development

FreeNAS 10 is the next version of FreeNAS, a FreeBSD-based open source NAS
operating system. This repo is where development of the GUI happens.

The FreeNAS 10 GUI is based on the Open Source [Montage Studio](http://www.montagestudio.com)
development framework. The web site for the company behind the project is somewhat out of date
as the company gone through some recent changes, but the [Github Repo](https://github.com/montagejs)
for the project is still active and many of the FreeNAS UI developers collaborate on the development
as necessary to meet the needs of the FreeNAS 10 UI.  The FreeNAS 10 GUI itself is probably the best
"living example" of Montage in action for those wishing to work on the GUI.

To learn how to run the FreeNAS 10 GUI stand-alone, please read the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/freenas/gui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document - it also
documents the process for contributing to the GI.
