# FreeNAS 10 GUI mockups go in this directory.

We use balsamiq mockups (https://balsamiq.com) for most of our mockups;
you can join as a trial account or ask your employer for a desktop app license
if you are going to be doing lots of them.

We will also accept screenshots or cell phone photos, if necessary, just so
long as it can be viewed and reviewed by others!
