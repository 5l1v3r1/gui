        </h2>

        <p>To get started developing the FreeNAS 10 GUI, simply do:</p>
        <p>
          <code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freenas/gui/master/bootstrap.sh | sh</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          This will analyze your development environment and bootstrap the
          development toolchain onto it as necessary, also checking out a
          working copy of this git repository for you.
        </p>

        <p>Alternatively, if you have already cloned this repo then just do:</p>

        <p><code>sh bootstrap.sh</code></p>

        <p>from the root of it to accomplish the same thing.</p>

        <h2>Using the FreeNAS 10 Development Environment</h2>
        <p>
          Once your development environment is initialized, run 'freenas-dev'
          to start the FreeNAS 10 SDK app
        </p>
        <p>
          You will need to choose whether to target a real FreeNAS instance in
          order to interact with the middleware, or to operate in "dumb mode",
          in which case it will run a local copy of the GUI webapp that
          simulates interaction with real data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the app is running, it will monitor your source files and
          automatically rebuild and restart the GUI every time a file changes.
        </p>

        <h2>FreeNAS 10 GUI Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          The FreeNAS 10 GUI is a React.js webapp served by mach running on
          node.js. The data flow uses the Flux architecture. For styles, it uses
          Twitter Bootstrap via React Bootstrap.

        <p>
          React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It is
          unlike MVC frameworks (eg. Ember, Backbone, Angular) as React aims only
          to provide self-updating, dynamic views. React uses a virtual DOM and
          hashes changes to the in-browser DOM, so its event-system, templates,
          and supported features are properly represented across all browsers,
          regardless of age.
        </p>
        <p>
          React is rendered serverside in FreeNAS 10, so that the initial
          payload sent to the user contains the HTML output of the React
          template, the virtual DOM is preloaded, and the component’s state is
          already initialized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because React focuses on creating “components” instead of “pages”, it
          also works well with Node and Browserify‘s require() syntax to keep
          files short, legible, and well organized. Components require() each
          other, creating a visible nested heirarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers who are familiar with writing static HTML pages should be
          quickly familiar with React’s pseudo-HTML syntax (JSX), which provides
          both a gentle learning curve and valid semantic abstractions for the
          JavaScript it represents.

          Twitter Bootstrap (TWBS) is one of the most popular and well-known
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks in use today. It has been widely
          adopted in a variety of websites, from personal blogs to Fortune 500
          companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The act of switching away from the toolkits used in previous versions
          of FreeNAS has given the project more freedom, but also introduced a
          lack of visible structure. Primarily, the use of TWBS in FreeNAS 10
          leverages a recognizable, well-documented platform with a shallow
          learning curve, and promotes the use of pre-existing patterns to
          design and organize content.
        </p>

        <h4>But what about LESS?</h4>
        <p>
          TWBS is used in FreeNAS 10 in a slightly unconventional way. Rather
          than using the pre-packaged download, the LESS source files for TWBS
          are compiled at build time, together with the FreeNAS 10 LESS files,
          to create a single master stylesheet.
        </p>

        <h4>Doesn’t TWBS require jQuery?</h4>
        <p>
          The JavaScript components are not included verbatim, but rather
          provided by React Bootstrap, a companion library that includes simple
          React reimplementations of the TWBS components without jQuery.

          LESS is a CSS-like language which compiles to CSS. It features
          variables, mixins, imports, and heirarchical class declarations which
          make development simpler. LESS can also be split into several
          different files for better organization and separation of concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          LESS is used in FreeNAS 10 primarily for its utility, and because
          Twitter Bootstrap is based on LESS. Compiling from LESS creates a
          single, unified file with fewer overwrites or complicated rules. The
          mixin architecture allows for powerful and dynamic expressions, as
          well as a simpler development process. It also means that the Twitter
          Bootstrap variables and mixins can be redefined or modified in our own
          LESS files, without modifying contents of the originals.

          Velocity is a ground-up reimplementation of jQuery’s $.animate()
          function. It is lightweight, and more consistently more performant
          than jQuery. It handles JavaScript-based UI animation, queues, and
          other transitions.

          D3 (short for Data Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for
          manipulating documents based on data. It is capable of providing rich
          visualization in the form of charts, graphs, maps, and more. In
          particular, it’s used for FreeNAS 10’s system overview, providing
          realtime graphs of CPU, network, disk, etc.

        <h2>The Flux Application Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The FreeNAS 10 UI is based on Facebook’s React, a declarative
          front-end view framework. Because of this, FreeNAS’ UI shares many of
          the same conventions as a standard React application does.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.htm">
            The Flux Architecture
          </a> is more of an architectural model than it is a framework or
          plugin. While it does include a Dispatcher module, Flux is primarily
          focused on enforcing unidirectional data flow, and accomplishes this
          through strict separation of concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          React does not depend on Flux, and vice versa, but between the two
          ideologies, it’s very easy to create a highly composible, declarative
          UI, with straightforward data flow and clear delegation of
          responsibilities

        <h3>Displaying Data</h3>
        <p>
          This section is short, since the strict separation of concerns means
          that React Views and Components display data, and do very little else.
          However, the primary View is a good touchstone for understanding the
          rest of the Flux architecture, since this is where user input is
          entered, and where server output is finally rendered.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>React View</h4>
        <img src="images/Flux/react_view.png" />
        <p>
          A React View can be any React component, but is generally the primary
          view open in the webapp. While other persistent components
          (navigation, notifications, widgets etc) function in slightly
          different ways, they’re broadly similar to a standard React View.
        </p>

      <section>
        <img src="images/Flux/groups_view_detail.png" />
        <p>Example of a basic view</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Role</h4>
        <p>
          A React View displays data to the user, and handles all interactions
          with the user. It is responsible for maintaining internal state, and
          updating itself when newer data is available.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Input</h4>
        <p>
          In the above screenshot, the Groups view is open. Following the diagram
          at the top of this guide, the Groups view receives new information from
          the Groups Flux Store. The view does not modify the Flux store, and has
          no opinions of its contents. When a React View is first initialized, it
          will often subscribe to an empty Flux store, and display nothing. In a
          few moments, when the Flux store is updated with the relevant data, the
          React View will re-render itself to display that data.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Output</h4>
        <p>
          The React View submits events, data, and requests to the Middleware
          Utility Class. In the example of the Groups View, if a group is edited -
          for example, its name is changed - upon saving, the updated group object
          is sent to the Groups Middleware Utility Class. The React View is
          ignorant of what will then happen to the group, and does not register a
          callback or perform any followup actions. When the group is updated, or
          an error occurs, it will be communicated through the same subscription
          to the Flux Store described above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Submitting User Input</h3>
        <p>
          The next step in the Flux Architecture is handling user input and
          sending it to the server. There is a deliberate pattern which will
          emerge, in which each “step” is ignorant of what came before it, and
          is only responsible for taking the data given to it and performing the
          appropriate next step.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Middleware Utility Class</h4>
        <img src="images/Flux/utility_class.png">
        <p>
          The Middleware Utility Class (MUC) is an abstaction provided by
          FreeNAS 10, and while suggested by Flux, it isn’t a strict requirement
          of the architecture. It provides an interface between the React View,
          the Middleware Client, and the Action Creators. When a user interacts
          with the FreeNAS 10 UI in a way that will require the Middleware
          Server to provide new data, the action is handled by the MUC, which
          calls the Middleware Client’s request() method with a callback for the
          appropriate Action Creator.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Role</h5>
        <p>
          The MUC pipes request data into a public method provided by the
          Middleware Client, and registers a callback that will be run when a
          matching response is receieved from the Middleware Server. The MUC
          does not modify input data, and does not manipulate response data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ambiguation provided by this class is necessary for a few reasons:
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h6>Consistency</h6>
        <p>
          Because the MUC exists outside of a React View’s lifecycle, it is able
          to guarantee that the registered callback will be run even if the
          original requesting View has closed.
        </p>
        <h6>Concurrency</h6>
        <p>
          Because the MUC is a singleton, it is also concurrently available to
          other views while retaining internal state.
        </p>
        <h6>Flexibility</h6>
        <p>
          Because the MUC is not combined with an ActionCreator, it is more
          composible, and may contain methods which register callbacks tied to
          many different ActionCreators.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, the architecture ensures that no replies are regarded as
          spurious by views which should have no knowledge of them, and the
          entire application maintains consistent state.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Input</h5>
        <p>
          The MUC recieves raw event data, objects, and other pre-packaged
          interactions from a React View. These might be as simple as a click
          event, or as complex as a dictionary object representing the changed
          properties for an array of hard disks. The MUC is deliberately
          ignorant of the Views which send it data.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Output</h5>
        <p>
          The MUC registers a callback with one of the Middleware Client’s
          public methods, ensuring that once the Middleware Client has recieved
          a response from the Middleware Server, the response data is passed
          into the callback. The callback is almost always a public method
          exposed by an ActionCreator class, which will handle the response
          data.

        <h4>Middleware Client</h4>
        <img src="images/Flux/middleware_client.png" />
        <p>
          The FreeNAS 10 UI uses a fully asyncronous WebSocket connection for
          communication with the hardware backend. The Middleware Client is a
          simple WebSocket client which handles the connection lifecycle, as
          well as the packaging, identification, transmission, and (initial)
          receipt of data.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Role</h5>
        <p>
          The Middleware Client exposes public methods for
          connecting/disconnecting, logging in/out, subscribing/unsubscribing
          from event types, and making specific requests to the Middleware
          Server. It can be thought of as a sort of companion to the FreeNAS 10
          Command Line Interface, as it provides similar functionality.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Dangers</h5>
        <p>
          The Middleware Client should not be accessed directly from a View.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directly accessing the Middleware Client can cause data to be returned
          and not handled, or treated as a spurious reply with no known origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Middleware Client does not and should not modify Flux Stores or
          Views.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Input</h5>
        <p>
          The Middleware Client exposes functions like request(), which are
          meant to be called from a Middleware Utility Class. These methods
          should be provided input data to send to the Middleware Server, and
          also provided at least on registered callback to a method exposed by
          an ActionCreator. The first callback provided will be used to handle
          responses that indicate success, and the second will be used to handle
          any errors.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Output</h5>
        <p>
          The relevant registered callback to the ActionCreator will be run when
          an appropriate response is received from the Middleware Server, and
          the callback function will take the response as its parameters.

        <h3>On the Server</h3>
        <p>
          This part of the guide is only provided to give a more complete
          understanding of the system as a whole. No GUI developer should ever
          need to worry about the specifics of the Middleware Server, or even
          the underlying FreeNAS OS. It may as well be a black box which
          receives packaged calls and returns new data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once loaded, the GUI is even capable of operation in the complete
          absence of a FreeNAS Server. This mode is largely intended for
          implementing GUI behavior while the relevant server functionality is
          unavailable.

        <p>
          The Middleware Server is a WebSocket server running on the same
          hardware as the core FreeNAS 10 OS. It collects and disburses system
          data requested by a Middleware Client. It is capable of handling event
          queues and multiple (non-blocking) requests. It can connect to many
          clients at the same time, and correctly triage requests and responses
          to each, concurrently.

        <h3>Handling Data from the Middleware</h3>
        <p>
          After being sent a request, the Middleware Client will receive a
          response from the Middleware Server. This isn’t necessarily a 1:1
          relationship, as a subscription request will cause the Middleware
          Server to send a stream of “patch” responses to the Middleware Client.
          Fortunately, the ActionCreators and other Flux errata are ignorant of
          their data’s sources, and only care about how to process it and where
          to send it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Action Creators</h4>
        <img src="images/Flux/actioncreator.png" />
        <p>
          Action Creators aren’t provided or created by Flux, but they are a
          necessary abstraction when piping multiple data streams into the same
          Dispatcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          While conceptually simple, an Action Creator class is an easy way to
          group similar functions, and attach identifying information to the
          packaged data. It limits code reuse, and creates a clear channel for
          handling data from the middleware. Flux suggests ActionCreator classes
          as an alternative to putting all of the processing functions inside
          the Dispatcher itself - reducing the size and complexity of the
          Dispatcher module and allowing for a more visible separation of
          concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also allows for simpler debugging, and creates a more extensible
          and composible platform than just calling
          <code>FreeNASDispatcher.dispatch()</code> directly would.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Role</h5>
        <p>
          Action Creators handle response data from the middleware, process and
          tag it as necessary, and call the appropriate method within the
          Dispatcher to perform the next step.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Input</h5>
        <p>
          ActionCreator methods are registered as callbacks by Middleware
          Utility Classes, and are called by the Middleware Client when a
          response is given for the original request. The response data is
          passed into the ActionCreator function, where it is packaged, tagged,
          and processed (if necessary).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Output</h5>
        <p>
          ActionCreator methods call shared methods within the Dispatcher, and
          send them the payload data. It’s the responsibility of these methods
          to identify the source of their payload, so the ActionCreator needs
          only to select the correct handler in the Dispatcher.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Flux Dispatcher</h4>
        <img src="images/Flux/freenas_flux.png" />
        <p>
          The Dispatcher broadcasts payloads to registered callbacks.
          Essentially, a store will register with the Dispatcher, indicating
          that it wants to run a callback when the Dispatcher broadcasts data
          of a certain “action type”.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Role</h5>
        <p>
          The Dispatcher is only responsible for broadcasting data to registered
          callbacks (Flux Stores). It contains handler functions that will tag
          the payload with a source, and these are selected by the
          ActionCreator. Primarily, they assist with debugging, and are a final
          opportunity to perform processing or tagging on the payload before it
          is broadcast to the Stores.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Input</h5>
        <p>
          Handler functions which ultimately call
          <code>FreeNASDispatcher.dispatch()</code> are registered in
          ActionCreators, and are called whenever the ActionCreator is receiving
          data.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Output</h5>
        <p>
          Whenever FreeNASDispatcher.dispatch() is called (usually by a handler
          function), the data parameter is broadcast to registered callbacks
          (Flux Stores)
        </p>
        <p>
          Callbacks are not subscribed to particular events. Each payload is
          dispatched to all registered callbacks, and it’s up to the callback to
          triage the action type, and decide whether to act.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Flux Stores</h4>
        <img src="images/Flux/store.png" />
        <p>
          A Flux store is, at its core, a simple JavaScript object. Stores are
          exported as singletons, so each store is both a single instance and
          globally accessible by any other module or view.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Role</h5>
        <p>
          Flux Stores are persistent data stores, accessible by any view or
          component. They can be relied on to always have up-to-date information
          from the Middleware, and obviate the need to perform long-polling
          operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stores additionally function as event emitters, and allow views to
          “subscribe” to the store’s “change” event, and register a callback to
          be run when the store is updated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, data upkeep and processing tasks are abstracted out of
          the view, and the view can rely on always having up-to-date data
          provided automatically by the store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stores also tend to have utility functions for retrieving specific
          data.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Input</h5>
        <p>
          Stores are only ever modified by the Dispatcher. They receive every
          broadcast payload the Dispatcher ever sends out, and will generally
          have a switch function that determines whether the broadcast is
          applicable to the type of data that the Store is concerned with.
          This determination is usually based on the action type added by the
          ActionCreator.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Output</h5>
        <p>
          Each React View will choose to subscribe to events emit by a specific
          Flux store, and additionally may request some or all of its data at
          various points in its lifecycle. When the Flux store updates, it will
          emit an event, causing the Change Listeners registered with that store
          to execute. Usually these will be functions to re-request the data
          updated in the store (which may cause the component to re-render to
          display the update).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Flux Store is ignorant of which views are subscribed to it, and
          persists as a singleton outside the lifecycle of any View or
          Component. In this way, it is always up to date, and can act as a
          single source of truth to multiple Components in parallel.
