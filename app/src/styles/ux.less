// USER EXPERIENCE STYLES
// ======================
// A collection of styling decisions that affect the overall "feel" of the
// application as a whole.

// To provide a more "app-like" experience, text-selection is disabled by
// default. It can be re-enabled with the `.allow-select()` mixin.
* {
  .no-select();
}

// All input selection should be allowed, and this needs to be overridden to
// prevent STUPID BROWSERS LIKE SAFARI from making it impossible to focus a text
// input, because YES THANKS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED
// Paragraph text is relatively rare in this webapp, and generally will be used
// in a context where selecting text would be sensible and applicable.
p, .p, input, .radio, .checkbox {
  .allow-select();
}

// By default, headings are decoration and not selectable text
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6,
.h1, .h2, .h3, .h4, .h5, .h6 {
  cursor: default;
}

// Buttons have a high affordance, and should not use the pointer style cursor
button, .btn, .button {
  cursor: default;
}
