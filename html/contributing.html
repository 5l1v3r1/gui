        <h2>How to Coordinate with the FreeNAS Team</h2>
        <p>
          FreeNAS 10 is still incredibly early in development. We're looking for
          contributors who can provide a concrete mockup for a given feature,
          work with us to refine the mockup, and then implement it
          independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our preferred way to see a mockup is with
          <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq Mockups</a>. If you
          don't have commit access, simply open an issue with your proposed
          mockup attached (Balsamiq also exports to PNG, if needed). A template
          project and any existing mockups may be found in the
          <a href="https://github.com/freenas/gui/tree/master/mockups">
            mockups
          </a> directory in the source. Balsamiq offers a 30-day free trial. If
          you don't have access to Balsamiq, we also accept cellphone pictures
          of whiteboards and cocktail napkins. All we need is something clear
          enough to review.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FreeNAS team at iXsystems has regular meetings to assess and
          provide feedback on mockups. Once a mockup is approved (probably a
          pretty informal process after the first look) the contributor should
          be prepared to implement that feature according to that mockup without
          substantial further feedback. This should be done in a feature branch
          for those with commit access and in a fork otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a feature is ready, send a pull request or merge your changes.
          Don't send a pull request or merge your changes until you're
          absolutely sure your feature is ready, because it will be summarily
          rejected if it's broken, substantially different from the mockup, or
          negatively impacts any other part of the GUI.
